    "### Student Performance Analyzer (Console-Based)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is a **console-based Student Performance Analyzer** developed in Python.  \n",
    "The purpose of this system is to help instructors **manage student academic records**, **calculate final results**, and **generate performance reports** in an organized and automated way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system works using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts and stores all student data in a **CSV file**, ensuring data persistence between program runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🎯 Project Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "The main objectives of this project are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To manage student records efficiently  \n",
    "- To calculate final scores using a fixed grading formula  \n",
    "- To convert numerical scores into letter grades  \n",
    "- To generate useful summary statistics for the class  \n",
    "- To save and load student data using a CSV file  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🛠️ Core Features of the System\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1️⃣ Student Record Management\n",
    "\n",
    "The system allows the instructor to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add new student records  \n",
    "- Remove existing student records  \n",
    "- Search for a student using their ID  \n",
    "- Update student information and marks  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each student record contains:\n",
    "- Student ID  \n",
    "- Student Name  \n",
    "- Midterm Exam Score  \n",
    "- Final Exam Score  \n",
    "- Assignment Score  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2️⃣ Final Score Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "The final score of each student is calculated using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "> final_score = (0.4 × midterm) + (0.5 × final_exam) + (0.1 × assignment_score)\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula gives more weight to the **final exam**, followed by the **midterm**, and then the **assignment**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3️⃣ Letter Grade Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "After calculating the final numerical score, the system converts it into a **letter grade** using conditional statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example grading logic:\n",
    "- A → Excellent performance  \n",
    "- B → Good performance  \n",
    "- C → Average performance  \n",
    "- D → Below average  \n",
    "- F → Fail  \n",
    "\n",
    "(This grading is implemented using `if-elif-else` conditions.)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4️⃣ Summary Statistics Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "The system generates useful class-level statistics, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Highest final score** in the class  \n",
    "- **Lowest final score** in the class  \n",
    "- **Class average score**  \n",
    "- **Grade distribution**, showing the number of students in each letter grade  \n",
    "\n",
    "These statistics help instructors quickly understand overall class performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5️⃣ CSV File Handling (Data Persistence)\n",
    "\n",
    "- All student records are stored in a **CSV file**  \n",
    "- Data is **automatically loaded** when the program starts  \n",
    "- Any changes (add, update, delete) are **saved back to the CSV file**  \n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that student data is **not lost** when the program is closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧠 Programming Concepts Used\n",
    "\n",
    "This project uses the following Python concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Object-Oriented Programming (Classes & Objects)  \n",
    "- File Handling using CSV  \n",
    "- Conditional Statements  \n",
    "- Loops  \n",
    "- Functions and Modular Design  \n",
    "- Exception Handling (for safe input and file operations)  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The Student Performance Analyzer is a **simple, modular, and efficient system** designed to manage academic data in a structured way.  \n",
    "It demonstrates strong use of **Python fundamentals**, **OOP principles**, and **real-world problem solving**, making it suitable for academic assignments and beginner-level software projects.\n",

    "#### 1️⃣ `import csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `csv` module is used to **work with CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files**.  \n",

    "#### 2️⃣ `import os`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `os` module is used to **interact with the operating system**.  \n",
    "In this project, it is mainly used to **check whether the CSV file exists or not** before reading or writing data.  \n",
